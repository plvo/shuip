# Creating a Registry Item

## Overview

shuip items live at `packages/registry/items/<category>/<name>/`. `packages/registry/scripts/generate.ts` scans them and emits every artifact (registry.json, __index__.ts, stubs, MDX symlinks, public/r/*.json). Get the folder right, run the generator, the rest cascades. CLAUDE.md has the layout & path-mapping reference — this skill is the procedure.

**Categories & prefixes:** `components` · `blocks` (registry:block) · `react-hook-form` (prefix `rhf-`) · `tanstack-form` (prefix `tsf-`). The folder name is **unprefixed**; the script adds the prefix.

## When to Use

- "Add a component / block / form field to shuip"
- "Publish X via the shadcn registry"
- "Create a new rhf-* / tsf-* item"
- A newly added item doesn't appear in `registry.json` or in the docs site
- Migrating an internal component from `packages/ui/` into a publishable item

## Procedure

### 1. Pick category and unprefixed name

Create `packages/registry/items/<category>/<name>/`. `<name>` has NO prefix — `rhf-` / `tsf-` is applied by the generator. Naming the folder `rhf-foo` publishes as `rhf-rhf-foo`.

### 2. Write `component.tsx` (exact filename)

- Import shadcn primitives via `@/components/ui/<name>`. These become `registryDependencies` (the consumer's shadcn CLI will install them).
- Never import `@/components/ui/shuip/*` from a `component.tsx` — circular; stubs are for the docs app, not for items themselves.
- Use the same `register: UseFormRegisterReturn<...>` prop pattern as the existing RHF fields (see `input-field/component.tsx`).
- **Schemas / types may be exported** when the item describes a domain shape — see `address-field/component.tsx` which exports `addressSchema` and `AddressData`. For format-only validation (E.164, URL, etc.), exporting a regex or zod schema next to the component is fine; consumers can opt in.

### 3. Write `default.example.tsx`

- Import the new component via the stub alias: `@/components/ui/shuip/<cat-subdir>/<name>` where `<cat-subdir>` is `react-hook-form` / `tanstack-form` / `blocks`, or omitted for `components`.
- Never import via relative `./component`. The example must exercise the same path consumers will use after `shadcn add`.
- The default example is keyed as `<prefixed-name>.example` in `__index__.ts`.

### 4. Add at least one variant example

Beyond the default, add `<variant>.example.tsx` showing a meaningful alternate use (e.g. `email.example.tsx`, `validation.example.tsx`, `tooltip.example.tsx`). This keeps documentation richer than a single canonical preview and proves the component is flexible. Variants are keyed as `<prefixed-name>.<variant>.example`. Look at `input-field/` for the multi-example pattern.

### 5. Write `index.mdx` — but only for components / RHF / TSF

Frontmatter must include `registryName: <prefixed-name>`. Use `<ItemExamples />` to render the previews and `<TypeTable />` for props. Model on a sibling item's mdx.

**Blocks are different:** do NOT put `index.mdx` in `items/blocks/<name>/`. Block docs are real MDX files in `apps/docs/content/blocks/<name>.mdx` (a separate fumadocs collection). Putting `index.mdx` in a block's item folder makes the generator create a dead symlink under `content/docs/blocks/` that no collection reads — the page silently doesn't appear.

### 6. Optional: extras and meta

- `extras/<file>.action.ts` → installed at `./actions/shuip/<file>.ts` on the consumer side.
- `extras/<file>.<ext>` → installed at `./components/ui/shuip/<file>.<ext>`.
- `meta.shuip.json` with `{ "dependsOn": ["<other-shuip-item>"] }` for cross-item registry deps that the import scanner cannot detect.
- If an extras file is referenced from `component.tsx` via a new alias not already mapped (the only precedent is `@/actions/shuip/places`), add the path mapping to **both** `apps/docs/tsconfig.json` and `packages/registry/tsconfig.json`. Forgetting either breaks IDE resolution or the docs build.

### 7. Run the generator and verify

```bash
bun registry:generate
```

Confirm in the output:
- `[generate] N items processed` with N incremented by 1
- No `[generate] skipping <cat>/<name>: no component.tsx` warning for your item (that warning means the filename is wrong and the item is invisible)

Then sanity-check the produced artifacts:
- New entry in `packages/registry/registry.json` (correct prefixed name, expected `registryDependencies` and `dependencies`)
- Stub at `packages/registry/stubs/<cat-subdir>/<name>.tsx` (for blocks: `packages/registry/stubs/blocks/<name>.tsx`)
- Symlink at `apps/docs/content/docs/<cat>/<name>.mdx` (only for components / RHF / TSF — blocks won't have one)

### 8. End-to-end build

```bash
bun build:docs
```

This chains `registry:generate` → `registry:build` (apps/docs/public/r/*.json) → `next build`. If it succeeds, the item is installable.

## Generated Artifacts — Don't Edit

`registry.json`, `__index__.ts`, `stubs/**`, `apps/docs/public/r/**`, `apps/docs/content/docs/<cat>/<name>.mdx` (symlinks), and `apps/docs/content/docs/<cat>/.gitignore` are all regenerated. Edits are clobbered. Always edit the source under `items/`.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Folder prefixed (`rhf-foo`) | Item published as `rhf-rhf-foo` | Drop the prefix; generator adds it |
| `component.tsx` missing or misnamed | `[generate] skipping ...` warning; item invisible | Filename must be exactly `component.tsx` |
| Example imports `./component` | Preview works locally; the actual install path is unverified | Use `@/components/ui/shuip/<cat-subdir>/<name>` |
| `component.tsx` imports `@/components/ui/shuip/*` | Circular reference | Import shadcn primitives via `@/components/ui/<name>` |
| Block has `index.mdx` in its item folder | Symlink lands in `content/docs/blocks/`, fumadocs doesn't read it, page absent | Move the MDX to `apps/docs/content/blocks/<name>.mdx`; remove the symlink |
| Edits write to the MDX symlink in `content/docs/` | Edit succeeds (writes through the symlink) but the source-of-truth confusion is real | Edit `items/<cat>/<name>/index.mdx` |
| Skipping `registry:generate` after adding files | New item never appears | Always run it; `bun build:docs` chains it for you |
| `bun add` for a shared dep | Catalog drift between workspaces | Add via the root `workspaces.catalog` (or sub-catalog), reference as `"catalog:"` |
| Aliased extras with mapping in only one tsconfig | IDE or build breaks | Mirror in both `apps/docs/tsconfig.json` and `packages/registry/tsconfig.json` |
| Skipping the variant example | Doc page shows only one preview, looks thin | Add at least one `<variant>.example.tsx` showing an alternate prop usage |

## Red Flags — STOP

- About to write to `stubs/`, `__index__.ts`, `registry.json`, `apps/docs/public/r/`, or a `content/docs/<cat>/<name>.mdx` symlink
- Folder name starts with `rhf-` or `tsf-`
- An `.example.tsx` has `from './component'` (relative)
- A `component.tsx` has `from '@/components/ui/shuip/`
- Putting an `index.mdx` in `items/blocks/<name>/`
- `[generate] N items processed` with N unchanged after you added the item
- Adding a path mapping in only one tsconfig
