## About

`ResponsiveDialog` is a smart dialog component that automatically adapts to the user's screen size:

- **Desktop (â‰¥1024px)**: Renders as a `SideDialog` with flexible positioning
- **Mobile (&lt;1024px)**: Renders as a `Drawer` for better mobile UX

Unlike traditional dialogs that force the same experience across all devices, `ResponsiveDialog` provides the optimal interface for each screen size while maintaining a consistent API.

## Built-in features

- **Automatic responsive behavior**: Switches between side dialog and drawer based on screen size
- **6 positions (desktop)**: Choose from `top-left`, `top-right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-right`, `left`, `right`
- **Flexible sizes (desktop)**: Predefined sizes (`xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`)
- **Mobile-optimized**: Uses native drawer with swipe gestures on mobile
- **Lightweight**: Combines existing components without additional overhead
- **Accessible**: Inherits accessibility features from both SideDialog and Drawer

## Installation


## Usage

### Basic responsive dialog

<CodeHighlight code={`<ResponsiveDialog>
  <ResponsiveDialogTrigger asChild>
    <Button>Open Dialog</Button>
  </ResponsiveDialogTrigger>
  <ResponsiveDialogContent>
    <ResponsiveDialogHeader>
      <ResponsiveDialogTitle>Settings</ResponsiveDialogTitle>
      <ResponsiveDialogDescription>
        Manage your preferences and account settings.
      </ResponsiveDialogDescription>
    </ResponsiveDialogHeader>
    <ResponsiveDialogFooter>
      <ResponsiveDialogClose asChild>
        <Button variant="outline">Cancel</Button>
      </ResponsiveDialogClose>
      <Button>Save</Button>
    </ResponsiveDialogFooter>
  </ResponsiveDialogContent>
</ResponsiveDialog>`} language='tsx' />

### Different positions (desktop only)

Desktop positions are ignored on mobile where the drawer behavior takes precedence:

<CodeHighlight code={`// Notification from bottom-right
<ResponsiveDialog position="bottom-right">
  <ResponsiveDialogTrigger asChild>
    <Button>Show Notification</Button>
  </ResponsiveDialogTrigger>
  <ResponsiveDialogContent>
    <ResponsiveDialogHeader>
      <ResponsiveDialogTitle>Success!</ResponsiveDialogTitle>
      <ResponsiveDialogDescription>Your changes have been saved.</ResponsiveDialogDescription>
    </ResponsiveDialogHeader>
  </ResponsiveDialogContent>
</ResponsiveDialog>

// User menu from top-right
<ResponsiveDialog position="top-right" size="sm">
  <ResponsiveDialogTrigger asChild>
    <Button variant="ghost" size="icon">
      <User className="size-4" />
    </Button>
  </ResponsiveDialogTrigger>
  <ResponsiveDialogContent>
    <ResponsiveDialogHeader>
      <ResponsiveDialogTitle>Account</ResponsiveDialogTitle>
    </ResponsiveDialogHeader>
    <div className="space-y-2">
      <Button variant="ghost" className="w-full justify-start">
        Profile Settings
      </Button>
      <Button variant="ghost" className="w-full justify-start">
        Sign out
      </Button>
    </div>
  </ResponsiveDialogContent>
</ResponsiveDialog>`} language='tsx' />

### Custom breakpoints

Control when the dialog switches between desktop and mobile modes:

<CodeHighlight code={`// Use predefined breakpoints
<ResponsiveDialog breakpoint="sm">  {/* Switches at 640px */}
  <ResponsiveDialogTrigger asChild>
    <Button>Small Breakpoint</Button>
  </ResponsiveDialogTrigger>
  <ResponsiveDialogContent>
    <ResponsiveDialogHeader>
      <ResponsiveDialogTitle>Mobile at 640px</ResponsiveDialogTitle>
      <ResponsiveDialogDescription>
        This dialog becomes a drawer on screens smaller than 640px.
      </ResponsiveDialogDescription>
    </ResponsiveDialogHeader>
  </ResponsiveDialogContent>
</ResponsiveDialog>

// Use custom pixel values
<ResponsiveDialog breakpoint={900}>
  <ResponsiveDialogTrigger asChild>
    <Button>Custom Breakpoint</Button>
  </ResponsiveDialogTrigger>
  <ResponsiveDialogContent>
    <ResponsiveDialogHeader>
      <ResponsiveDialogTitle>Custom at 900px</ResponsiveDialogTitle>
      <ResponsiveDialogDescription>
        Switches to mobile mode at exactly 900px and below.
      </ResponsiveDialogDescription>
    </ResponsiveDialogHeader>
  </ResponsiveDialogContent>
</ResponsiveDialog>`} language='tsx' />

### Different sizes (desktop only)

Size props affect the desktop side dialog appearance:

<CodeHighlight code={`// Small dialog for quick actions
<ResponsiveDialog size="xs">
  <ResponsiveDialogTrigger asChild>
    <Button variant="outline">Quick Action</Button>
  </ResponsiveDialogTrigger>
  <ResponsiveDialogContent>
    <ResponsiveDialogHeader>
      <ResponsiveDialogTitle>Confirm</ResponsiveDialogTitle>
      <ResponsiveDialogDescription>Are you sure?</ResponsiveDialogDescription>
    </ResponsiveDialogHeader>
  </ResponsiveDialogContent>
</ResponsiveDialog>

// Large dialog for complex content
<ResponsiveDialog position="left" size="lg">
  <ResponsiveDialogTrigger asChild>
    <Button variant="outline">Navigation Menu</Button>
  </ResponsiveDialogTrigger>
  <ResponsiveDialogContent>
    <ResponsiveDialogHeader>
      <ResponsiveDialogTitle>Navigation</ResponsiveDialogTitle>
    </ResponsiveDialogHeader>
    <nav className="space-y-2">
      <Link href="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>
      <Link href="/projects">Projects</Link>
      <Link href="/settings">Settings</Link>
    </nav>
  </ResponsiveDialogContent>
</ResponsiveDialog>`} language='tsx' />
