## Ready-to-use theme toggle

The button automatically cycles through these states:
- **System**: Uses the user's OS preference (üñ•Ô∏è Laptop icon)
- **Light**: Forces light mode (‚òÄÔ∏è Sun icon)  
- **Dark**: Forces dark mode (üåô Moon icon)

With `ThemeButton`, a complete theme switcher in one line:

<CodeHighlight code={`// With ThemeButton - simple and complete
<ThemeButton />

// With text label
<ThemeButton withText={true} />`} language='tsx' />
